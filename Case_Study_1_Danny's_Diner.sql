----Problem Statement
--Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, 
--especially about their visiting patterns, how much money theyâ€™ve spent and also 
--which menu items are their favourite. Having this deeper connection with his 
--customers will help him deliver a better and more personalised experience for his loyal customers.

--He plans on using these insights to help him decide whether he should expand the existing customer
-- loyalty program - additionally he needs help to generate some basic datasets so his team can easily 
--inspect the data without needing to use SQL.

--Danny has provided you with a sample of his overall customer data due to privacy issues 
--- but he hopes that these examples are enough for you to write fully functioning SQL queries 
--to help him answer his questions!

--Danny has shared with you 3 key datasets for this case study:

--sales
--menu
--members
